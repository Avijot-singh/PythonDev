USE OOP TO REDUCE REDUNDANCY AND INCREASE REUSABILITY
To map with real world scenarios, we started using objects in code.
This is called object oriented programming.
such as lists and strings are objects
'''

# Class
# Class is a blueprint for creating objects
'''
Example:

class Student: # Class name to start with captial letter
    name = 'Avi Singh'
'''

#Objects (instance)
'''
s1 = Student()
print(s1.name)
